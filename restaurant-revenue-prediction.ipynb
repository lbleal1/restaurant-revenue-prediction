When the wrong location for a restaurant brand is chosen, the site closes within 18 months and operating losses are incurred. \n","\n","Finding a mathematical model to increase the effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites would allow TFI to invest more in other important business areas, like sustainability, innovation, and training for new employees.
